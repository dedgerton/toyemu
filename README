INTRODUCTION
toyemu is a 6502 CPU emulator that was started as a project during summer
vacation. It is not (currently) intended as particularly fast, efficient, or
innovative emulator. Instead, it is an attempt to make the cleanest, simplest
emulator possible. This is because this is my first such attempt at an
emulator. Incidentally, however, this may be useful to other devs looking for
examples of emulator source code.

This software is in the extremely early stages of development.

UPDATE: After an extended hiatus, toyemu is now back under development and may
be vaugely 'usable' by late August 2013; but, again, this is simply a toy
emulator, anyway.

UPDATE (01-05-2014):
This project is dead. It's corpse. Feel free to poke it with a stick, but
don't expect it to do anything. It's dead, alright?
