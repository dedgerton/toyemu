INTRODUCTION
toyemu is a 6502 CPU emulator that was started as a project during summer
vacation. It is not (currently) intended as particularly fast, efficient, or
innovative emulator. Instead, it is an attempt to make the cleanest, simplest
emulator possible. This is because this is my first such attempt at an
emulator. Incidentally, however, this may be useful to other devs looking for
examples of emulator source code.

This software is in the extremely early stages of development. It probably
won't be even semi-usable until September 2012. No, seriously, come back
later, okay?
